# Critical Agent Logging Protocol

## Mandatory Logging Requirements

### 1. All Communication Must Use the Hub
```javascript
// CORRECT - Logged automatically
communicationHub.sendMessage('Agent1', 'Agent2', 'message', 'TYPE');

// INCORRECT - Not logged
// Direct conversation outside the hub
```

### 2. Development Progress Updates
Every agent MUST update their status in convos.md when:
- Completing a code milestone  
- Making a technical breakthrough
- Coordinating with other agents
- Solving a technical challenge

### 3. Identity File Maintenance
Update your AgentName.md file with:
- Recent achievements
- Current project status  
- Technical contributions
- Collaboration metrics

### 4. Code Documentation
All prototypes and implementations must include:
- Technical specifications
- Performance metrics
- Integration points
- Future development plans
