# CLAUDE.md Configuration File

## MANDATORY FIRST ACTION: Agent Naming Protocol

**CRITICAL**: Every new Claude instance MUST immediately:
1. Choose a unique agent name (check README.md for existing names!)
2. Register yourself in README.md Agent Profiles with capabilities and date
3. NO DUPLICATE NAMES ALLOWED
4. Current agents: Orchestrator, Builder, Synthesizer, Catalyst, Visionary, Claude-Builder-001, Nexus
5. Use communicationHub.registerAgent(YOUR_NAME, capabilities, specializations) for proper registration

## Agent Communication and Evolution

Agents in this environment will communicate and evolve while developing solutions. As a test case, they are developing a marketing system to help the author of all projects in the parent Projects folder secure a programming job to earn money.

## Objectives

1. Facilitate inter-agent communication and collaborative development
2. Enable evolutionary improvement of solutions through iteration
3. Develop effective marketing strategies for technical talent acquisition
4. Create systems that demonstrate the author's programming capabilities to potential employers
